# TriHelix — Core Philosophy (Technical Manifest)

**Motto:** Coordinate · Evolve · Sustain

## 1. Overview
TriHelix is a meta‑ecosystem: Atlas (planner), Genom (creator), Diagno (analyst), orchestrated by Helix (Technological Unified Intelligence, TÜİ). Each core system is **independent** yet forms a **symbiotic loop** when combined.

## 2. Tri‑System Independence
- **Atlas (Plan):** strategy, architecture, roadmap.
- **Genom (Create):** code generation, patterns, CI scaffolding.
- **Diagno (Analyze):** health, risk, recommendations.

**Law #1:** Each system must be operable and valuable on its own.

## 3. Helix (TÜİ) Layer
Helix aligns intent ↔ plan ↔ code ↔ health. It owns the loop, learns from telemetry, and adapts plans. Human interaction and conversion live in Helix.

**Law #2:** Helix does not only orchestrate — it **learns and changes**.

## 4. Human Interface & Conversion
- Human ↔ Helix: natural dialogue + CLI.
- Development Layer: Atlas + Genom + Diagno lifecycle.
- Conversion Layer: Helix’s explanation, approval, and feedback interface.

## 5. Lifecycle (Core Spiral)
```
Atlas → Plan → Spec → Roadmap
        ↓
Genom → Generate → Build → CI
        ↓
Diagno → Analyze → Report → Learn
        ↓
Helix → Learn → Adapt → Restart
```

## 6. Architecture of Awareness
| Layer  | Function            | AI Type           |
|------- |---------------------|-------------------|
| Atlas  | Plan & Strategy     | Heuristic / LLM   |
| Genom  | Code & Structure    | Generative / AST  |
| Diagno | Analysis & Insight  | Analytical / LLM  |
| Helix  | Orchestrate & Learn | Meta‑Learning     |

## 7. Doctrine
TriHelix is not a single tool; it’s a **living circuit** that plans, creates, understands, and learns — iteratively.
