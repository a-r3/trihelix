# TriHelix — Vision (Concise)
TriHelix unifies three independent systems — Atlas (plans), Genom (creates), Diagno (analyzes) —
into a living, self‑adapting development organism driven by Helix. The long‑term vision is an
autonomous ecosystem that plans, builds, evaluates and improves itself continuously.
